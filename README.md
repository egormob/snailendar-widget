# repo-template-cfpages

Use this template to bootstrap new Cloudflare Pages projects. After cloning or using the template, add your application code on top of the static skeleton in `public/`.

Cloudflare Pages serves the contents of the `public` directory from the `main` branch, so static files and build outputs should be placed there by default. Pull Requests automatically provide preview deployments, letting you verify changes before merging.

Branch protection settings are managed in the GitHub UI under **Settings â†’ Branches/Rules**. Adjust the toggles there if the protection check workflow highlights missing requirements.
